# CSE423 Project Guidelines

Please read the instructions carefully before starting your project.

## Group Formation
- This is a group project. Solo projects are **NOT** allowed.
- Groups must consist of exactly 3 members. **Exceptions:**
  - If the total number of students in the section doesn't match, one group of 4 members or 2 members is allowed.
  - Lab faculty may merge or break groups to fit the criteria if needed.
- Cross-section grouping is strictly prohibited. Groups must be formed within the same section.

## Project Rules
- Only `GL_POINTS` can be used for shape drawing. No other shape drawing functions are allowed.
- The project must include methodologies applied in Assignment 2 (Midpoint Line and Midpoint Circle).
- Avoid common or plagiarized ideas from the internet. Novelty in your project idea will be highly rewarded.
- During viva, all group members must explain any part of the project, regardless of individual contributions. Marks may vary for each group member based on their viva performance.
