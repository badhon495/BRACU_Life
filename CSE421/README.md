# CSE421 - Computer Networks (3 credits)

This course is an introduction to fundamental concepts in the design and implementation of computer communication networks, their protocols, and applications. Topics include overview of network architectures, applications, network programming interfaces (e.g., sockets), transport, congestion, routing, and data link protocols, addressing, local area networks, wireless networks, and network security. Examples are drawn primarily from the Internet (e.g., TCP, UDP, and IP) protocol suite.
