# CSE221 - Algorithms (3 credits)

This course addresses the study of efficient algorithms, their analyses and effective algorithm design techniques. Standard algorithm design strategies such as Divide and Conquer paradigm, Greedy method, Dynamic programming, Backtracking, Basic search and traversal techniques, Graph algorithms, Elementary parallel algorithms, Algebraic simplification and transformations, Lower bound theory, NP-hard and NP-complete problems are discussed in the course.
